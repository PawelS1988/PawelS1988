Hey, Hi, Hello, Hola, Ohayo, Wassup and CzeÅ›Ä‡ ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ”­ I'm currently working on finishing my coding boot camp [almost finished]
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: ["React Framework", "Node.js"]
ğŸ‘¯ I'm looking to work on a project that uses React and Node to practice and eventually master those technologies
ğŸ’¬ Ask me about: [ "Video games" ]

âš¡ Fascinating fact: Playing action video games trains people to make right decisions faster. How? Players develop a heightened sense of their surroundings and that helps them multitask. And surgeons that regularly play video games make 37% fewer errors and perform their tasks 27% faster than peers.
